It was a map, yellowed with age, showing strange lands across a vast ocean. \\\"This belonged to Christopher Columbus,\\\" her grandfather whispered. \\\"Legend says it guided him to the New World.\\\"\\n\\nFascinated, Lucia traced the faded lines with her finger. She imagined Columbus standing on the deck of his ship, the Santa Mar\\u00eda, peering at this very map. The wind whipped through his hair as he gazed at the horizon, wondering what lay beyond.\\n\\nAs night fell, Lucia dreamed she was aboard the Ni\\u00f1a, one of Columbus's smaller ships. She felt the gentle rocking of the waves and heard the creak of wood. Sailors bustled around her, adjusting ropes and sails. \\n\\nSuddenly, a shout rang out: \\\"Land ho!\\\" Lucia rushed to the bow, her heart pounding. Through the mist, she saw a strip of green - an island! As they drew closer, she spotted people on the shore. They looked different from anyone she'd ever seen before.\\n\\nColumbus stepped onto the beach, planting a flag in the sand. He spoke to the islanders, trying to communicate through gestures. Lucia realized this moment would change the world forever, for better or worse.\\n\\nWhen she awoke, Lucia carefully rolled up the map. She knew she held a piece of history in her hands - a window into a time of great discovery and profound change. As she drifted back to sleep, she wondered what new worlds remained to be explored.\\n\\nQuestions:\\n\\n1. If Columbus's fleet sailed 2,500 nautical miles in 50 days, what was their average speed per day?\\n\\n2. The Santa Mar\\u00eda was 62 feet long. If the Ni\\u00f1a was 3/4 the length of the Santa Mar\\u00eda, how long was the Ni\\u00f1a?\\n\\n3. Columbus brought 90 men on his first voyage. If 1/3 sailed on the Santa Mar\\u00eda, 1/4 on the Ni\\u00f1a, and the rest on the Pinta, how many men were on the Pinta?\\n\\n4. What type of simple machine would sailors use to raise heavy sails?\\n\\n5. In the story, what does the word \\\"bow\\\" mean?\\n   A) A weapon for shooting arrows\\n   B) To bend forward\\n   C) The front of a ship\\n   D) A decorative ribbon\\n\\n6. If Columbus left Spain on August 3, 1492 and arrived in the Bahamas on October 12, 1492, how many days did the voyage take?\\n\\n7. The map in the story is described as \\\"yellowed with age.\\\" What literary device is this an example of?\\n\\n8. If each sailor needed 3 liters of water per day, how many liters would be needed to supply 90 men for 70 days?\\n\\n9. Draw and label a simple diagram of a caravel, the type of ship Columbus used.\\n\\n10.

He wasn’t a sailor himself, but his grandfather had sailed with Columbus on the *Niña*. Tiberio kept his grandfather's greatest treasure: a fragment of a map. It wasn't a complete map, just a corner, showing a swirling blue ocean and a tiny, emerald island marked with a strange symbol – a star inside a circle.\n",

He spoke of scurvy and storms, of the men who dreamed of gold, and others who just dreamed of home. One day, a young girl named Sofia, who loved listening to Tiberio's tales, noticed that the blue ink of the ocean on the map appeared to be fading quicker than the green ink of the land. \"It's as if the sea is trying to tell you something,\" she said. Tiberio just smiled. He knew stories faded. But he also knew, somewhere, that island still existed, waiting to be rediscovered.\n",
